After an overview of the basic properties of semiconductors, the p-n junction and MOS capacitors are described and the MOSFET is modeled as a large-signal device. Two port small-signal amplifiers and their realization using single stage and multistage CMOS building blocks are discussed. Sinusoidal steady-state signals are introduced and the techniques of phasor analysis are developed, including impedance and the magnitude and phase response of linear circuits. The frequency responses of single and multi-stage amplifiers are analyzed. Differential amplifiers are introduced. ",

It provides pedagogical training by introducing the big ideas of teaching and learning, and illustrating how to put them into practice. The course is divided into three sections\u2014instructing the individual; a group; and psycho-social factors that affect learning at any level. These sections are designed to enhance any intern\u2019s, tutor\u2019s, or TA\u2019s teaching skillset. Class is discussion based, and covers theoretical and practical pedagogical aspects to teaching in STEM. An integral feature of the course involves providing weekly tutoring sessions.",
