A series of lab exercises provide the background and practice of digital design using a modern FPGA design tool flow.  Digital synthesis, partitioning, placement, routing, and simulation tools for FPGAs are covered in detail.  The labs exercises culminate with a large design project, e.g., an implementation of a full three-stage RISC-V processor system, with caches, graphics acceleration, and external peripheral components.  The design is mapped and demonstrated on an FPGA hardware platform.",

The course is divided into three sections—instructing the individual; a group; and psycho-social factors that affect learning at any level. These sections are designed to enhance any intern’s, tutor’s, or TA’s teaching skillset. Class is discussion based, and covers theoretical and practical pedagogical aspects to teaching in STEM. An integral feature of the course involves providing weekly tutoring sessions.",

        "description": "An introduction to digital and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher-levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs and projects.  \nThe class has two lab options: ASIC Lab (EECS 151LA) and FPGA Lab (EECS 151LB). Students must enroll in at least one of the labs concurrently with the class.",

It provides pedagogical training by introducing the big ideas of teaching and learning, and illustrating how to put them into practice. The course is divided into three sections—instructing the individual; a group; and psycho-social factors that affect learning at any level. These sections are designed to enhance any intern’s, tutor’s, or TA’s teaching skillset. Class is discussion based, and covers theoretical and practical pedagogical aspects to teaching in STEM. An integral feature of the course involves providing weekly tutoring sessions.",

It provides pedagogical training by introducing the big ideas of teaching and learning, and illustrating how to put them into practice. The course is divided into three sections—instructing the individual; a group; and psycho-social factors that affect learning at any level. These sections are designed to enhance any intern’s, tutor’s, or TA’s teaching skillset. Class is discussion based, and covers theoretical and practical pedagogical aspects to teaching in STEM. An integral feature of the course involves providing weekly tutoring sessions.",
